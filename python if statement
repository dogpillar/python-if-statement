im trying to get this:

>>> age = 20
>>> if age >= 20:
...   print("You are an adult")
>>> else:
...   print("You are under 20!")



but when i click Enter on my keyborad after the if statement, i get this:

>>> age = 20
>>> if age >= 20:
...   print("You are an adult")
... else:
...   print("You are under 20!")
SyntaxError: multiple statements found while compiling a single statement


How do I achieve the >>> in front of else, instead of getting ... else?
